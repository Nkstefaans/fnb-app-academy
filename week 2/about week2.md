# Week 2: Building the Avengers App with HTML and CSS

## Overview
In Week 2 of the FNB App Academy, we built upon our HTML knowledge from Week 1 and introduced CSS to create a more visually appealing and interactive web application. We developed the Avengers App, a multi-page website showcasing Marvel's iconic superhero team.

## What We Accomplished

### HTML Structure and Organization
- Created a complete web application with multiple HTML files organized in the `avengers-app` folder
- Developed an index page (home page) that displays a gallery of Avenger character images
- Created individual HTML pages for each Avenger character:
  - Thor (avenger-1.html)
  - Iron Man (avenger-2.html)
  - Hulk (avenger-3.html)
  - Black Widow (avenger-4.html)
  - Hawkeye (avenger-5.html)
  - Captain America (avenger-6.html)
- Added supporting pages:
  - About page with information about the Avengers team
  - Contact page with fictional contact information

### Interactive Navigation and Linking
- Linked each Avenger image on the home page to its corresponding character page
- Implemented a consistent navigation menu across all pages
- Added navigation links to Home, About, and Contact pages on every page
- Created a cohesive user experience with intuitive navigation between pages

### Content Development
- Populated each Avenger page with character information from the avengersInfo.txt file
- Added biography details including full name, place of birth, alignment, race, and gender
- Included power statistics for each character (intelligence, strength, speed, etc.)
- Created informative content for the About page explaining the Avengers initiative
- Developed a Contact page with fictional contact information

### CSS Styling and Design
- Applied consistent styling across all pages using an external style.css file
- Implemented responsive image styling in the gallery
- Created visually appealing navigation menus with hover effects
- Used CSS to style lists with custom pointer images
- Applied consistent typography, colors, and spacing throughout the application
- Added subtle animations (transform effects on image hover)

### Web Development Best Practices
- Maintained consistent HTML structure across all pages
- Used semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Separated content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
- Implemented proper indentation and code formatting
- Added appropriate alt text to images for accessibility
- Created a responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Key Skills Learned
- HTML document structure and semantic elements
- CSS styling and selectors
- Linking between pages and external resources
- Image handling and optimization
- Navigation design and implementation
- Content organization and presentation
- Web accessibility considerations
- Consistent design principles

## Next Steps
As we move forward, we'll continue to enhance our web development skills by:
- Adding more interactive elements with JavaScript
- Implementing form validation on the Contact page
- Exploring responsive design techniques for mobile devices
- Learning about web performance optimization

This week's project has provided a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, demonstrating how these technologies work together to create engaging web applications.
